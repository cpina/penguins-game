# See README.md to understand the game.
#
# The first challenge that we found was to know
# which possible positions the pieces could be put
# in the board.
#
# Given that the board is quite small and the pieces
# quite irregular we opted for listing all the positions
# that the pieces could be in.
#
# Feel free to not use this and generate them programatically!
#
# There are 4 pieces named L, C, Z and R
# (based on the "shape" of the pieces).
# The board is not a square board: it has a bit of an
# irregular shape. This made things a bit more difficult.

# See the image:
# The penguins are in this positions (following the same
# position-scheme as the pieces here):
#
# [(0,0), (1,2), (2,3), (3,1)]
# So, the format is: (column, row), zero-indexed, count the number
# of empty ice-blocks from the top-left to the position.
#
# In the same ...
# The piece is in the position: [(0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 1), (2, 1)]
# A representation of the board using public_utils.print_solution:
#
#    Z     Z
# P     Z     Z
#    C     P
# C     C     R
#    P     R
# C     L     R
#    L     L
# L     P     R
